      "blurb": "In 1968 (the year of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the signing of the Civil Rights Act) Gilliam began staining and folding raw canvases and suspending them from the wall, creating immersive bleeds of color. For Gilliam, 'the year 1968 was one of revelation . . . something was in the air, and it was in that spirit that I did the Drape paintings.' The works/' tension and free fall—subject to forces beyond the artist/'s control—paralleled the social turmoil of the time. As a Black artist and civil rights leader, Gilliam deliberately worked against the grain. Unlike many of his peers, he refrained from literal depictions or messages in his art. He was committed to abstraction, stating, 'the expressive act of making a mark and hanging it in space is always political. My work is as political as it is formal.' Gilliam/'s titles refer to historical and artistic events alike: 10/27/69 marks the date he completed this painting, against the backdrop of mass demonstrations protesting the Vietnam War.

By the late 19th century, he envisioned a series of grand compositions, or grandes décorations, surrounding viewers with water, flora, and sky. This vision materialized in about forty large panels, including Water Lilies, which Monet worked on from 1914 until his death in 1926. Water Lilies features a luminous pool of green and blue, reflecting lavender-tinged clouds. Darker strokes bleed into the left panel, while reddish-green vegetation dominates the right, blurring into near-abstraction without a horizon. After Monet’s death, twenty-two panels were gifted to France and installed at Paris/’ Musée de l/’Orangerie. The remaining canvases stayed in his studios until the late 1940s, when collectors and MoMA curators showed interest.",

      "blurb": "Mark Bradford, born in 1961 in Los Angeles, found inspiration for his art while working as a hairstylist in his mother's salon. He realized that end papers used in perms could be transformed into art. Layered and manipulated, these delicate sheets became his primary medium, showcased in works like 'Let's Walk to the Middle of the Ocean', a mixed media piece blending paper bits into stunning art. Bradford, now a prominent figure in American art, explores themes of class, race, and gender through collages, sculptures, videos, and large-scale installations. Based in South Los Angeles, where he grew up, Bradford is known for integrating art into his urban community. His breakthrough came in 2001 at the Studio Museum in Harlem's exhibition for young Black artists, and by 2017, he represented the United States at the Venice Biennale. Using found materials, Bradford acts as an urban archaeologist, often layering his art on maps or incorporating text to make social statements. His works resonate with themes from Black history to contemporary issues like the L.A. riots of the 1990s, blending aesthetic concerns with profound social commentary.",

      "blurb": "Jack Whitten, born in 1939 in Bessemer, Alabama, navigated a remarkable journey from the segregated South to New York's art scene amidst the civil rights movement. His work, however, diverges from literal representation, focusing instead on transforming perception through abstract forms. Experimenting in the early 1970s with Xerox and photographic techniques, Whitten poured acrylics and used unconventional tools like afro combs and squeegees to create dynamic, blurred compositions akin to rapid movement or radar scans. Amidst a climate favoring social realism, Whitten's art embraced mediums over messages, highlighting how societal struggles were evolving through mass media and technology.",

Colors overlap and merge atop layers of white paint, creating a dynamic chromatic web against an illusion of empty space. Despite the seeming spontaneity, Mitchell's process was deliberate and controlled, emphasizing the relationships between each brushstroke and the balance between figure and ground. Unlike many Abstract Expressionists, she eschewed a fully allover composition, aiming instead to capture the essence of 'feelings' and memories through her paint. Painted in 1957 when Mitchell was thirty-two and living in New York, 'Ladybug' reflects her commitment to conveying personal experiences rather than depicting nature directly.",

These products evoke cultural significance, rooted in histories of colonization and U.S. military presence in Asia. Shih’s intricate surface treatments make her objects uncannily realistic, blending gloss and matte techniques. Her social research, engaging over 20,000 Asian American followers, identifies Western products with Asian cultural resonance.

This drawing is part of the thousands of paintings and drawings on paper she began creating in 1951 in Japan. Despite their intimate scale, these compositions evoke a sense of vastness for the artist. Kusama described them as reflecting “the great depth of my inner heart.” Accumulation, like much of her later work, is based on repetition and stems from the aural and visual hallucinations she has experienced since age 10. “I translate the hallucinations and obsessional images that plague me into sculptures and paintings,” she explained.",

By combining serial repetition with an allover painting technique, Kusama blurred the line between figure and ground, giving equal importance to both the interlocking brushstrokes and the spaces between them.

Sze describes Fallen Sky as “filmic” due to its dynamic nature and ability to depict “how the landscape behaves.” The clay model for Fallen Sky was created through erosion, resulting in a piece that appears as a ruin in partial deterioration.
